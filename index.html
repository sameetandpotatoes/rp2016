                        <h4>Coming from Willard Airport</h4>
                        <p>Willard Airport is located south of UIUC. If driving, head north from the airport on the 45 and turn right onto Springfield â you'll soon find yourself on UIUC campus! Alternatively, you can catch a cab from the airport to the building or the 27N/270N Airbus will take you from Willard to the corner of Goodwin St and Clark St just outside the building.</p>

                        <h4>Coming from Amtrak Station</h4>
                        <p>Siebel Center is located 1 mile from the Champaign Amtrak Station. Most buses will take you to campus. The 100S and 120E run every few minutes. Ride one of these buses to the intersection of Wright St and White St, then walk east on Stoughton and you will find yourself at the Siebel Center!</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h4>Getting around Campus</h4>
                        <p>Most amenities are available within walking distance of the Siebel Center. However,
                            if walking isn't for you then Champaign-Urbana's public transit system can take you
                            where you need to go. Routes can be mapped using Google Maps or the CUMTD app and each
                            ride will cost you $1. No change is given on the buses, so bring exact fare with you!</p>
